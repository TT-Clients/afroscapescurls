jade at 12:29, Mar 14:
If you need to move the domain to the other hosting package to get SSL cert set up then thats fine
Vikash K at 12:30, Mar 14:
Jade, I really appreciate your time and patience here, and thanks you for staying connected with me and as I have reviewed the account and didn't find any active SSl for the website [ afroscapescurls.com ] , which is the reason the site is not secured:https://certs.godaddy.com/cert
jade at 12:31, Mar 14:
Yes, I've tried everything and met with support multiple times to get the SSL linked to this domain
I have installed it as well as rekeying the certificate and nothing has worked
So I need someone on your end to activate the SSL certificate for this domain
Vikash K at 12:34, Mar 14:
Jade, thank you for sharing the information and correct me if I am wrong here, as I can see that there is a SSL in the account for the domain
[ 46d.0d4.mywebsitetransfer.com ] , is the same SSL do you want to use for the domain
[ afroscapescurls.com ] , to secure it ?

Vikash K at 12:49, Mar 14:

jade at 13:17, Mar 14:

Vikash K at 13:19, Mar 14:
Jade, I really appreciate your understanding and patience here, and as I have reviewed the certificate looks like there is some difference in the domain, let us try to install the certificate once, or else we have to generate a new certificate here with the correct domain name.
And I request you to please once use the below link and follow the path once to install the new certificate in the hosting :https://host.godaddy.com/webhosting/cpanel/account/b9ae6e4e-d13b-11ea-81e3-3417ebe725c2/view

Cpanel admin -> SSL/TLS

In the Upload a New Certificate section, select Choose File and navigate to the .crt file you downloaded earlier and Select the file and then select Open.
jade at 13:23, Mar 14:
it says:ERROR: The system could not save certificate #1 because of an error: That certificate is already installed as “46d.0d4.mywebsitetransfer.com”. No valid certificate provided
I tried copy and pasting it from the pem file and that worked but it points to the wrong domain : 46d.0d4.mywebsitetransfer.com
Vikash K at 13:26, Mar 14:
Ohh, no worries and request you to please once use the below link and scroll down and come to the manage certificate section and click on the second option Install your certificate on the same site which is enabled now after rekey:https://certs.godaddy.com/cert/details/xb9payhxiymrukj8qouljvydcz4jd42a?cb=&app=
Then select Add Change.
Select Submit All Changes.
jade at 13:27, Mar 14:
it says reisiue not allowed for this certificate id
is there a way to compeletely remove and reinstall the cert on the correct domain?
Vikash K at 13:29, Mar 14:
Jade, sorry for the inconvenience caused to you and I really appreciate your understanding and patience here, and request you to please try once to complete the setup from the private browser, because this is the last step and after that the SSL will get installed on the site after sometime.
Or else we have to completely repeat the same process again to install a fresh new certificate.
jade at 13:31, Mar 14:
what do you mean to complete setup from a private browser?
Vikash K at 13:34, Mar 14:
Jade, I really appreciate your understanding and patience here, and here private browser means the incognito browser or you can try after completely removing the cache and cookies for the browser .
jade at 13:35, Mar 14:
So exactly which steps do I need to try from the incognito browser and what do I do when this doesnt work?
I've tried this over 5 times already and it does not work
Vikash K at 13:38, Mar 14:
Jade, I really appreciate your understanding and patience here, and request you to please once use the below link and scroll down and come to the manage certificate section and click on the second option Install your certificate on the same site which is enabled now after rekey:https://certs.godaddy.com/cert/details/xb9payhxiymrukj8qouljvydcz4jd42a?cb=&app=

Then select Add Change.
Select Submit All Changes.

jade at 13:16, Mar 14:
the chat is doing something strange
Vikash K at 13:16, Mar 14:
Yes I am right here and checking the certificate for you .
jade at 13:17, Mar 14:
oh ok, thank you
Vikash K at 13:19, Mar 14:
Jade, I really appreciate your understanding and patience here, and as I have reviewed the certificate looks like there is some difference in the domain, let us try to install the certificate once, or else we have to generate a new certificate here with the correct domain name.
Vikash K at 13:20, Mar 14:
And I request you to please once use the below link and follow the path once to install the new certificate in the hosting :https://host.godaddy.com/webhosting/cpanel/account/b9ae6e4e-d13b-11ea-81e3-3417ebe725c2/view

Cpanel admin -> SSL/TLS
Vikash K at 13:20, Mar 14:
Under Certificates (CRT), select Generate, view, upload, or delete SSL certificates.

In the Upload a New Certificate section, select Choose File and navigate to the .crt file you downloaded earlier and Select the file and then select Open.
jade at 13:23, Mar 14:
it says:ERROR: The system could not save certificate #1 because of an error: That certificate is already installed as “46d.0d4.mywebsitetransfer.com”. No valid certificate provided
jade at 13:25, Mar 14:
I tried copy and pasting it from the pem file and that worked but it points to the wrong domain : 46d.0d4.mywebsitetransfer.com
Vikash K at 13:26, Mar 14:
Ohh, no worries and request you to please once use the below link and scroll down and come to the manage certificate section and click on the second option Install your certificate on the same site which is enabled now after rekey:https://certs.godaddy.com/cert/details/xb9payhxiymrukj8qouljvydcz4jd42a?cb=&app=
Vikash K at 13:27, Mar 14:
Then select Add Change.
Select Submit All Changes.
jade at 13:27, Mar 14:
it says reisiue not allowed for this certificate id
jade at 13:28, Mar 14:
is there a way to compeletely remove and reinstall the cert on the correct domain?
Vikash K at 13:29, Mar 14:
Jade, sorry for the inconvenience caused to you and I really appreciate your understanding and patience here, and request you to please try once to complete the setup from the private browser, because this is the last step and after that the SSL will get installed on the site after sometime.
Vikash K at 13:30, Mar 14:
Or else we have to completely repeat the same process again to install a fresh new certificate.
jade at 13:31, Mar 14:
what do you mean to complete setup from a private browser?
Vikash K at 13:34, Mar 14:
Jade, I really appreciate your understanding and patience here, and here private browser means the incognito browser or you can try after completely removing the cache and cookies for the browser .
jade at 13:35, Mar 14:
So exactly which steps do I need to try from the incognito browser and what do I do when this doesnt work?
jade at 13:39, Mar 14:
i did this from an incognito browser and I get the same error
jade at 13:40, Mar 14:
Reissue not allowed for this certificateId.
Vikash K at 13:42, Mar 14:
Jade, sorry for the inconvenience caused to you and request you to please once use the below article and completely cleared the complete cache form the browser once:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop
jade at 13:42, Mar 14:
I'm a software engineer, I've already cleared my cache multiple times, I'll try again
no luck
Vikash K at 13:45, Mar 14:
Sure Jade and I request you to please wait for some time like 25-30 min once and then try once again .it will work for sure.
jade at 13:46, Mar 14:
it hasn't worked any of the multiple times Ive tried this process so I do not believe that
is there anything else you can look into on your end?
cache clearing doesnt take 25 to 30 mins to take effect
I know that as a software engineer
i specialize in web development
Vikash K at 13:51, Mar 14:
Jade, I completely understand your concern here and totally agree with you that the cache clearing doesn't take 25-30 minutes, but just to know that if there is multiple re-issue requests provided to any SSL certificate, so at this point the SSL itself takes around 30 minute to issue a fresh new another certificate for the given request, it's a global rule.
Which is the reason I am suggesting you to please wait for around 30 minute and then try once to perform the last step which I have provided to you .
jade at 13:53, Mar 14:
its actually been almost 30 minutes since we first tried this, i just scrolled up in chat to see
it will have been 30 minutes in 4 minutes
2 minutes until we hit the 30 minute mark
still getting the same error
Vikash K at 13:56, Mar 14:
Jade, I really appreciate your time and patience here, and Request you to please wait and then try once form the private browser only after clearing the complete cache and cookies form the browser:https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop
jade at 13:57, Mar 14:
ive done that before ive tried each time
still showing the same error
its officially been 32 minutes
Vikash K at 14:01, Mar 14:
Jade, sorry for the inconvenience caused to you and request you to please once help me with the error screenshot form the private browser so that I can check with the team once for you ?
jade at 14:01, Mar 14:
it wont allow me to send screenshots in this chat
the direct error is pink and says Reissue not allowed for this certificateId.
Vikash K at 14:03, Mar 14:
Jade, I really appreciate your time and patience here, and request you to please once help me with the screenshot at vikash2334@GoDaddy.com
jade at 14:05, Mar 14:

Vikash K at 14:17, Mar 14:
Jade, I really appreciate your time and patience here, and request you to please try once to rekey the SSL using the below link from the private browser only :

jade at 14:17, Mar 14:

Vikash K at 14:19, Mar 14:
Jade, just for confirmation are you able to rekey the certificate now ?
jade at 14:20, Mar 14:
I get You entered an invalid CSR. Please try again.
any other suggestions?
does this need to be further escalated?
Vikash K at 14:24, Mar 14:
Jade, sorry for the inconvenience caused to you and I completely understand your concern here and here we have need to generate the new CSRs to rekey the SSL once.
jade at 14:24, Mar 14:
ok, where do I go to generate a new CSR
Vikash K at 14:26, Mar 14:
Request you to please once use the below link and click on the cpanel admin button :https://host.godaddy.com/webhosting/cpanel/account/b9ae6e4e-d13b-11ea-81e3-3417ebe725c2/view

Vikash K at 14:31, Mar 14:
Yes Please :https://certs.godaddy.com/cert/details/oehn2c5cjga2lydfvneszgebuio5zftt
jade at 14:32, Mar 14:
it says certificate request mending reissuance
Vikash K at 14:33, Mar 14:
No worries, please refresh the page once
jade at 14:33, Mar 14:
i have refreshed and see the rekey in the certificate history
Vikash K at 14:34, Mar 14:
Perfect, now request you to please permanently delete all the previously downloaded certificates form your system before you download the new certificate .
jade at 14:35, Mar 14:

Vikash K at 14:35, Mar 14:
